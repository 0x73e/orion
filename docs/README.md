# Orion

Orion is an open-source, community-driven framework dedicated to Provable Machine Learning. It provides essential components and a new ONNX runtime for building verifiable Machine Learning models using [STARKs](https://starkware.co/stark/).

### ü§î What is ONNX Runtime?

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange), is an open-source standard created to represent deep learning models. The aim of its development was to enable interoperability among diverse deep learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch. By offering a universal file format, ONNX allows models trained in one framework to be readily applied in another for inference, eliminating the need for model conversion.

Ensuring compatibility with ONNX operators facilitates integration into the ONNX ecosystem. This enables researchers and developers to pre-train models using their preferred framework, before executing verifiable inferences with Orion.
